A web application to record and distribute information about endangered species of marine animals

  Due to various human activities like habitat destruction, pollution, and fishing, endangered marine species face a severe threat of extinction. It is crucial to understand the specifics and places of these species to stop their extinction. To build a comprehensive database that can be used for conservation efforts, this research seeks to collect information about and map out the locations of endangered species. Developing a MERN based web application will be a result of the research project. A database containing information on the location, species and their migrating patterns will be developed when the system is completed. The research's conclusions will help preserve endangered marine animals by offering important knowledge that policymakers and conservationists can use to make educated choices. In the end, this study will contribute to the preservation of endangered marine species and help their survival for future years.
